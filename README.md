# POSYTYF
Repository for the models developed in the WP1 and WP2 of the POSYTYF project

# WP 1: Scenarios (Universitat Politecnica De Catalunya)
Please read the file 'Models Introduction.pdf' for a brief introduction about the models.

The models developed so far were:

- Scenario 17 depicted on Fig.37 page 55 of the Deliverable D1.1
- Selected Scenario 1 depicted on Fig.68 page 91 of the Deliverable D1.1
- Selected Scenario 2 depicted on Fig.75 page 96 of the Deliverable D1.1
- Selected Scenario 3 depicted on Fig.81 page 103 of the Deliverable D1.1

# WP 2: Models (HTW Berlin - University of Applied Sciences)

Models in the context of - Deliverable 2.2 - Objectives and assessment criteria for controller design within the POSYTYF project (https://posytyf-h2020.eu/). See also Deliverable 2.2 for a model description.

The archive D22_HTW_Berlin.7z contains the following Simulink/Matlab models:

1. Primary = primary energy conversion
   - HY = hydro power plant
   - PV = photovoltaic power plant
     - PO = perturb and observation algorithm
     - EX = fast generic exact algorithm
   - SP = solat thermal power plant
   - WT = wind turbine power plant
     - OS1 = operational strategy 1
     - OS2 = operational strategy 2

2. Secondary = secondary energy conversion
   - SG = synchronous generator
   - INV = inverter / converter
     - GFOL = grid following mode
     - GFOR = grid forming mode
       - EMT = electromagnetic transient simulation model
       - RMS = root mean square model
